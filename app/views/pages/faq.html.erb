        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          In the tech world, "hacking" doesn't mean breaking into systems. It means
          <strong class="text-white">creative problem-solving with code</strong>. When developers
          say they're "hacking," they mean they're building something quickly, experimenting with
          ideas, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible. It's about resourcefulness,
          rapid prototyping, and turning an idea into a working project&mdash;often in a short
          amount of time. Think of it as the art of making things work.

        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          A hackathon is an event&mdash;typically lasting 24 to 48 hours&mdash;where people come
          together to build software projects from scratch. Teams form, pick a challenge or idea,
          and race to create a working prototype by the deadline. At the end, teams present their
          projects to judges and compete for prizes.

        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Hackathons are open to <strong class="text-white">all skill levels</strong>. You don't
          need to be an expert programmer to participate. Many hackathons welcome designers,
          business minds, and complete beginners. It's one of the best ways to learn by doing,
          meet other builders, and add real projects to your portfolio.

          <span class="text-folk-green">virtual</span>, or
          <span class="text-folk-orange">hybrid</span>. Some focus on specific themes like
          AI, climate, health, or fintech. Most are free to enter, and many offer mentorship,
          workshops, and networking alongside the competition.
