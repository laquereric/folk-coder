      title: "FAQ"
      subtitle: "Common questions about FolkCoder and the hackathon world."
      q1_title: "What's \"Hacking\"?"
      q1_answer_html: >-
        In the tech world, "hacking" doesn't mean breaking into systems. It means
        <strong class="text-white">creative problem-solving with code</strong>. When developers
        say they're "hacking," they mean they're building something quickly, experimenting with
        ideas, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible. It's about resourcefulness,
        rapid prototyping, and turning an idea into a working project&mdash;often in a short
        amount of time. Think of it as the art of making things work.
      q2_title: "What's a Hackathon?"
      q2_answer_p1_html: >-
        A hackathon is an event&mdash;typically lasting 24 to 48 hours&mdash;where people come
        together to build software projects from scratch. Teams form, pick a challenge or idea,
        and race to create a working prototype by the deadline. At the end, teams present their
        projects to judges and compete for prizes.
      q2_answer_p2_html: >-
        Hackathons are open to <strong class="text-white">all skill levels</strong>. You don't
        need to be an expert programmer to participate. Many hackathons welcome designers,
        business minds, and complete beginners. It's one of the best ways to learn by doing,
        meet other builders, and add real projects to your portfolio.
      q2_answer_p3_html: >-
        They can be <span class="text-folk-purple">in-person</span>,
        <span class="text-folk-green">virtual</span>, or
        <span class="text-folk-orange">hybrid</span>. Some focus on specific themes like
        AI, climate, health, or fintech. Most are free to enter, and many offer mentorship,
        workshops, and networking alongside the competition.

      hero_title: "Congratulations!"
      hero_subtitle: "You just built a working Rails application with a single command. Welcome to the SwarmPod curriculum on FolkCoder."
      what_happened_title: '"Wait, what just happened?"'
      what_happened_p1_html: >-
        You clicked a lesson card on your local app and landed here. The application you just created looks deceptively simple — three cards, a footer, done. That feeling of <strong class="text-gray-200">"is that it?"</strong> is intentional.
      what_happened_p2_html: >-
        What actually happened is more interesting: you ran <code class="bg-gray-800 text-folk-green px-2 py-1 rounded">rails new --template</code> and a fully structured, production-ready application appeared — styled, routed, and ready for you to build upon. No more wrestling with boilerplate setup. No more copy-pasting configuration files. <strong class="text-gray-200">One command, and you were ready to code.</strong>
      philosophy_title: "Why It's Built This Way"
      philosophy_subtitle_html: >-
        The simplicity <strong class="text-gray-200">IS</strong> the lesson. Every architectural choice in SwarmPod is deliberate, designed to reflect how modern, high-performing teams ship software.
      philosophy_multi_repo_title: "Multi-Repo Architecture"
      philosophy_multi_repo_text: "Each concern lives in its own repository. This is how real teams ship software, enabling independent development and deployment cycles."
      philosophy_gems_title: "Modular Gems"
      philosophy_gems_text: "SwarmPod Core is a Ruby gem, not a monolithic feature. This promotes reusability and clean separation of concerns."
      philosophy_secrets_title: "Secrets Outside the Repo"
      philosophy_secrets_text: "Your credentials and API keys never touch version control. SwarmPod enforces best practices for secrets management from the very beginning."
      philosophy_containers_title: "Containerized Environments"
      philosophy_containers_text: "Docker Compose makes \"works on my machine\" a guarantee, not an excuse. Every developer gets an identical, consistent environment."
      philosophy_templates_title: "Template-Driven Setup"
      philosophy_templates_text: "One command creates a consistent starting point for every team member. This eliminates configuration drift and dramatically speeds up onboarding."
      philosophy_summary_html: >-
        You just ran <code class="bg-gray-800 text-folk-green px-2 py-1 rounded">rails new --template</code> and had a working app. That's <strong class="text-white">agentic programming</strong> — letting tools do the setup work so you can focus on what truly matters: building.
      curriculum_cta_title: "Start the Curriculum"
      curriculum_cta_text: "That \"wow\" moment was just the beginning. The full SwarmPod curriculum will guide you through every aspect of this professional workflow. You'll master secrets management, Docker, GitHub Actions, and more — all within the context of the application you just created."
