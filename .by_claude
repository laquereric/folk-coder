# .by_claude — Claude's Working Notes for FolkCoder

## What This File Is
This is Claude's own reference document for the folk-coder project.
It captures understanding, decisions, and the step-by-step plan as
work progresses. Updated as each step completes.

## Project Understanding

FolkCoder is two things:

1. **A web presence** (folkcoder.com) — a social platform where
   developers find hackathon teammates, discover events, showcase
   projects, and access structured curricula like SwarmPod.

2. **An AI-centered business infrastructure** — the backend systems,
   tooling, and workflows (powered by AI) that manage the business
   FolkCoder generates: user onboarding, content delivery, community
   management, partner/sponsor coordination.

SwarmPod (swarmpod-core) is the first featured framework on the
platform. It provides one-command Rails app scaffolding with
multi-repo architecture, Docker, and secrets management baked in.
The SwarmPod curriculum is the initial content funnel that drives
developers from localhost to FolkCoder registration.

### Key Content Documents
- `folkcoder_homepage_content.md` — Homepage structure and copy
- `folkcoder_next_page_content.md` — /next landing page (post-SwarmPod setup)
- `folkcoder_personas_and_use_cases.md` — Three personas (Carlos, Amy, Brenda) and seven use cases

---

## Documentation Convention

Progress is tracked in `docs/StepN/` folders. Each step includes:
- Screenshots showing the state of the work
- Any relevant notes or artifacts

This mirrors how the project owner works — visual proof at each stage,
nothing skipped, nothing assumed.

### Completed Steps

**Step 0 — Project Init**
- Git repo initialized
- Content MDs and README in place
- `.claude` and `.by_claude` created
- Claude Code session started in VS Code
- Evidence: `docs/Step0/VsCode._git.png`, `docs/Step0/VsCode_claude.png`

## Step-by-Step Plan (Taking It Slow)

Each step is a discrete, completable unit. No step starts until the
previous one is reviewed and confirmed. Screenshots document each.

### Step 1 — Stack Decision (DECIDED)
**Rails.** Vanilla Rails. No JS framework bolted on, no static site
generator. SwarmPod is Rails-native, FolkCoder is Rails-native. One
ecosystem, one language, one set of conventions.

What this means concretely:
- Ruby on Rails 8 (Hotwire/Turbo/Stimulus for interactivity)
- SQLite for dev, Postgres for production
- Import maps (no Node, no Webpack, no esbuild unless forced)
- Rails built-in auth or a simple gem (Devise, or Rails 8 auth generator)
- Hosting TBD (Railway, Render, Fly.io, Hatchbox — all Rails-friendly)
- Domain and DNS setup for folkcoder.com

Remaining decisions for Step 1:
- Hosting provider
- Domain/DNS status (do you already own folkcoder.com?)
- `rails new` now, or after hosting is sorted?

### Step 2 — Landing Page (Homepage)
Implement the homepage from `folkcoder_homepage_content.md`:
- Hero, How It Works, Features, Community, Starting Gate, CTA
- Responsive, clean, no over-engineering
- Deploy to a staging URL

### Step 3 — The /next Page
Implement the post-SwarmPod redirect page from
`folkcoder_next_page_content.md`:
- Congratulations flow, curriculum CTA, registration hook
- Wire the localhost redirect path

### Step 4 — Registration & User Profiles
- Auth system (email, GitHub OAuth)
- Developer profile creation (skills, roles, collaboration style)
- Database and user storage

### Step 5 — AI Infrastructure (Phase 1)
Begin the AI-centered business layer:
- Define what "AI manages the business" means concretely
- Candidate areas: content generation, user matching, onboarding
  automation, support, analytics, sponsor outreach
- Choose tools and APIs (Claude API, automation frameworks)

### Step 6 — Hackathon Hub
- Hackathon directory with search/filter
- Team formation and recruiting boards
- Project showcase pages

### Step 7 — AI Infrastructure (Phase 2)
- Smart team matching
- Curriculum progress tracking
- Automated community management
- Business analytics and reporting

### Future Steps
- Sponsor/partner portal
- Payment and subscription infrastructure
- Mobile experience
- Community features (forums, messaging)

## Current Status

**We are at Step 0, complete.**
Next action: Discuss and decide Step 1 (stack selection) when ready.

## Principles
- Take it slow. One step at a time.
- Document everything visually (screenshots in docs/StepN/).
- No over-engineering. Build what's needed now.
- AI-first where it adds real value, not for show.
- The owner reviews and approves before moving forward.
