# .by_claude — Claude's Working Notes for FolkCoder

## What This File Is
This is Claude's own reference document for the folk-coder project.
It captures understanding, decisions, and the step-by-step plan as
work progresses. Updated as each step completes.

---

## Project Understanding

FolkCoder is two things:

1. **A web presence** (folkcoder.com) — a social platform where
   developers find hackathon teammates, discover events, showcase
   projects, and access structured curricula like SwarmPod.

2. **An AI-centered business infrastructure** — the backend systems,
   tooling, and workflows (powered by AI) that manage the business
   FolkCoder generates: user onboarding, content delivery, community
   management, partner/sponsor coordination.

SwarmPod (swarmpod-core) is the first featured framework on the
platform. It provides one-command Rails app scaffolding with
multi-repo architecture, Docker, and secrets management baked in.
The SwarmPod curriculum is the initial content funnel that drives
developers from localhost to FolkCoder registration.

### Key Content Documents
- `docs/input/folkcoder_homepage_content.md` — Homepage structure and copy
- `docs/input/folkcoder_next_page_content.md` — /next landing page (post-SwarmPod setup)
- `folkcoder_personas_and_use_cases.md` — Three personas (Carlos, Amy, Brenda) and seven use cases

---

## Documentation Convention

Progress is tracked in `docs/StepN/` folders. Each step includes:
- Screenshots showing the state of the work
- Any relevant notes or artifacts

This mirrors how the project owner works — visual proof at each stage,
nothing skipped, nothing assumed.

---

## Stack Decisions

- **Framework:** Vanilla Rails 8 (Hotwire/Turbo/Stimulus)
- **CSS:** Tailwind via CDN (no npm, no build step)
- **JS:** Import maps (no Node, no Webpack)
- **DB:** SQLite (dev + production via Solid Cache/Queue/Cable)
- **Deployment:** Kamal to Hostinger VPS (srv824516.hstgr.cloud)
- **Registry:** GHCR (ghcr.io/cbiperson/folk-coder)
- **SSL:** Let's Encrypt via kamal-proxy (auto)
- **GitHub:** CbiPerson/folk-coder

---

## Infrastructure Access

### Secrets (~/.swarmpod/secrets/)
- `GITHUB_TOKEN.sh` — GitHub PAT (used for GHCR auth via Kamal)
- `GITHUB_USERNAME.sh`, `GITHUB_ACCOUNT.sh` — CbiPerson
- `HOSTINGER_VPS.sh` — srv824516.hstgr.cloud
- `HOSTINGER_ACCOUNT.sh` — LaquerEric@gmail.com
- `HOSTINGER_PASSWORD.sh` — Hostinger panel password
- `HOSTINGER_API_TOKEN.sh` — Bearer token for Hostinger REST API
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY.sh` — Claude API key
- `Z_AI_ACCOUNT.sh`, `Z_AI_PASSWORD.sh` — Z.ai credentials

### SSH
- Key: ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 (folkcoder-deploy)
- Installed on VPS root@srv824516.hstgr.cloud

### DNS
- Managed via Hostinger API: `PUT https://developers.hostinger.com/api/dns/v1/zones/folkcoder.com`
- A record: folkcoder.com -> 31.97.8.47
- CNAME: www -> folkcoder.com
- CAA: allows letsencrypt.org (and others)

### VPS Notes
- Ubuntu Noble (24.04), kernel 6.8.0-88-generic, amd64
- Snap Docker was replaced with official Docker CE 29.2.1 (Snap sandboxing broke Kamal's docker cp and env file access)
- Kamal proxy listens on 80/443, terminates SSL

---

## Completed Steps

### Step 0 — Project Init
- Git repo initialized
- Content MDs and README in place
- `.claude` and `.by_claude` created
- Claude Code session started in VS Code
- Evidence: `docs/Step0/VsCode._git.png`, `docs/Step0/VsCode_claude.png`

### Step 1 — Stack Decision + Rails Scaffold
- Decided: vanilla Rails 8, Tailwind CDN, SQLite, import maps
- Ran `rails new . --database=sqlite3 --skip-test --name=folk_coder`
- All existing files (MDs, docs/) preserved
- Removed Rails default README.md (kept our README)

### Step 2 — Homepage
- Generated PagesController with `home` action
- Set root route to `pages#home`
- Built full homepage from `folkcoder_homepage_content.md`:
  Hero, How It Works, Features (4 cards), Community stats,
  Starting Gate (SwarmPod spotlight), For Everyone (3 cards),
  Final CTA
- Layout includes nav bar, footer, Tailwind CDN config with
  custom folk-* color palette
- SVG icons for feature cards

### Step 3 — /next Page
- Added `next_page` action to PagesController
- Route: `get '/next', to: 'pages#next_page'`
- Built full page from `folkcoder_next_page_content.md`:
  Congratulations hero, "What just happened", Core Philosophy
  (5 principle cards), Curriculum CTA, Why Register (3 benefits)

### Step 4 — Docker
- Verified Rails 8 generated Dockerfile (multi-stage, production-ready)
- Created `docker-compose.yml` (web service on port 3000, RAILS_MASTER_KEY from env)
- Built and verified: localhost:3000 returns 200 on / and /next

### Step 5 — Push to GitHub
- Created repo via `gh repo create CbiPerson/folk-coder --public`
- Pushed all commits to https://github.com/CbiPerson/folk-coder

### Step 6 — Deploy to Hostinger VPS
- Configured `config/deploy.yml` for Kamal:
  - Server: srv824516.hstgr.cloud
  - Registry: ghcr.io (CbiPerson)
  - SSL: true, host: folkcoder.com
- Configured `.kamal/secrets` to pull from ~/.swarmpod/secrets/
- Enabled `config.assume_ssl` and `config.force_ssl` in production.rb
- Set mailer host to folkcoder.com
- Generated SSH key and installed on VPS via sshpass
- Updated DNS A record via Hostinger API (84.32.84.32 -> 31.97.8.47)
- Replaced Snap Docker with official Docker CE on VPS
- Ran `kamal setup` — container healthy, SSL provisioned
- **folkcoder.com is live** (HTTPS, 200 on / and /next)

## Step-by-Step Plan (Remaining)

### Step 4 (next) — Registration & User Profiles
- Auth system (Rails 8 auth generator or Devise)
- Developer profile creation (skills, roles, collaboration style)
- Database migrations, user model

### Step 5 (next) — AI Infrastructure (Phase 1)
- Define what "AI manages the business" means concretely
- Candidate areas: content generation, user matching, onboarding
  automation, support, analytics, sponsor outreach
- Choose tools and APIs (Claude API, automation frameworks)

### Step 6 (next) — Hackathon Hub
- Hackathon directory with search/filter
- Team formation and recruiting boards
- Project showcase pages

### Step 7 (next) — AI Infrastructure (Phase 2)
- Smart team matching
- Curriculum progress tracking
- Automated community management
- Business analytics and reporting

### Future Steps
- Sponsor/partner portal
- Payment and subscription infrastructure
- Mobile experience
- Community features (forums, messaging)

## Current Status

**folkcoder.com is live.**
Homepage and /next page deployed to Hostinger VPS via Kamal.
Next action: Registration & user profiles when ready.

## Principles
- Take it slow. One step at a time.
- Document everything visually (screenshots in docs/StepN/).
- No over-engineering. Build what's needed now.
- AI-first where it adds real value, not for show.
- The owner reviews and approves before moving forward.
- Stay vanilla Rails.
