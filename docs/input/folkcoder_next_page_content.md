# FolkCoder.com/next: Content

This document outlines the content for the `/next` page, which serves as the dedicated landing page for developers who have just completed the `swarmpod-core` setup. The content is designed to bridge the gap between their local setup experience and the FolkCoder community, directly addressing the personas and use cases previously defined.

## 1. Hero Section

**(The user lands here immediately after being redirected from their local Rails app at `http://localhost:3000/next`)**

**Headline:**
# Congratulations!

**Sub-headline:**
You just built a working Rails application with a single command. Welcome to the SwarmPod curriculum on FolkCoder.

## 2. The "Aha!" Moment Explained

**Section Title:**
## "Wait, what just happened?"

**Section Content:**
You clicked a lesson card on your local app and landed here. The application you just created looks deceptively simple—three cards, a footer, done. That feeling of **"is that it?"** is intentional.

What actually happened is more interesting: you ran `rails new --template` and a fully structured, production-ready application appeared—styled, routed, and ready for you to build upon. No more wrestling with boilerplate setup. No more copy-pasting configuration files. **One command, and you were ready to code.**

## 3. The Core Philosophy

**Section Title:**
## Why It's Built This Way

**Section Content:**
The simplicity **IS** the lesson. Every architectural choice in SwarmPod is deliberate, designed to reflect how modern, high-performing teams ship software. You didn't just run a command; you adopted a professional-grade workflow.

**(This would be a visually engaging section, perhaps with icons for each principle)**

**Principle 1: Multi-Repo Architecture**
Each concern (like the web frontend and the API) lives in its own repository. This is how real teams ship software, enabling independent development and deployment cycles.

**Principle 2: Modular Gems**
SwarmPod Core is a Ruby gem, not a monolithic feature. This promotes reusability and clean separation of concerns, making your application easier to maintain and scale.

**Principle 3: Secrets Outside the Repo**
Your credentials and API keys never touch version control. SwarmPod enforces best practices for secrets management from the very beginning, preventing costly security leaks.

**Principle 4: Containerized Environments**
Docker Compose makes the phrase "works on my machine" a guarantee, not an excuse. Every developer on your team gets an identical, consistent environment, every single time.

**Principle 5: Template-Driven Setup**
One command creates a consistent starting point for every team member. This eliminates configuration drift and dramatically speeds up onboarding for new developers.

**The Punchline:**
You just ran `rails new --template` and had a working app. That's **agentic programming**—letting tools do the setup work so you can focus on what truly matters: building.

## 4. The Path Forward: The Curriculum

**(A prominent, visually distinct call-to-action box, as seen in the screenshot)**

**Headline:**
