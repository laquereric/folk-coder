Priority 2: SwarmPod Curriculum Platform

Current State: The /next page promises a "full SwarmPod curriculum" that will track progress, but no curriculum content or progress tracking system exists.

Why This Matters: This is the core value proposition for users coming from the local SwarmPod setup. If they register and find no curriculum, the platform will fail to deliver on its promise, leading to immediate churn.

Recommended Action:

•
Design and build a curriculum structure with modules and lessons

•
Create the first 3-5 lessons covering the topics mentioned on the /next page:

•
Lesson 1: Understanding Multi-Repo Architecture

•
Lesson 2: Secrets Management Best Practices

•
Lesson 3: Docker & Containerization

•
Lesson 4: GitHub Actions & CI/CD

•
Lesson 5: Deploying Your SwarmPod Application



•
Implement a progress tracking system that saves which lessons a user has completed

•
Build a curriculum dashboard where users can see their progress and navigate between lessons

Success Metric: Registered users can access and complete at least one lesson, with their progress saved.
