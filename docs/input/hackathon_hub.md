Priority 3: Hackathon Hub (MVP)

Current State: The homepage prominently features the "Hackathon Hub" and an "Explore Hackathons" button, but no hackathon directory or listing functionality exists.

Why This Matters: The Hackathon Hub is one of the three core features of the FolkCoder platform. Without it, the platform feels incomplete and fails to deliver on a key promise.

Recommended Action:

•
Build a simple hackathon listing page with a searchable/filterable directory

•
Manually seed the database with 20-30 upcoming hackathons from sources like:

•
Major League Hacking (MLH)

•
Devpost

•
Hackathon.com

•
RubyConf and other conference-associated hackathons



•
Include basic fields: name, date, location (virtual/in-person), theme, prize pool, registration link

•
Implement basic filtering by date, theme, and location

Success Metric: Users can browse and filter a list of at least 20 real, upcoming hackathons.
